## Microservice API - The key to seamless server communication!
This library provides a structured way for different components of your Minecraft plugin to communicate with each other, resulting in seamless and efficient communication between servers.

# Using microservices
Using microservices for your Minecraft plugin is a better approach compared to
directly using MySQL, MongoDB, etc., in your code for several reasons:

- **Scalability**: Microservices allow you to scale individual components of your plugin independently, allowing you to handle increased traffic or load more efficiently.
- **Maintainability**: By breaking down your plugin into smaller, self-contained services, it becomes easier to maintain and update each component individually.
- **Improved security**: Microservices help to isolate different components of your plugin, reducing the risk of security breaches or vulnerabilities.
- **Better performance**: By breaking down your plugin into smaller components, you can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred between services.

In conclusion, using microservices for your Minecraft plugin provides numerous benefits, 
from improved scalability and maintainability to better performance and security.
